/// How long a cleanup pass is allowed to take.
///
/// `cleanup.timeout_s` was a FIXED wall-clock budget, but the work is linear in
/// the transcript: the model decodes at a roughly constant rate, so a long
/// dictation deterministically blows any fixed deadline — and burns the whole
/// budget before falling back, so the user waits the maximum and still gets raw
/// text. On-device history (2026-09-02, 219 dictations, `~/.pomvox/history.db`)
/// fits cleanup latency almost perfectly as a line in output length:
///
///     warm      (gap < 5 min):  ms ≈  564 + 9.07 · chars
///     post-idle (gap ≥ 5 min):  ms ≈ 2362 + 8.94 · chars
///
/// The SLOPES are identical — there is no post-idle throughput regression, and
/// the prompt-prefix caches are reused across idle eviction exactly as designed
/// (`cleanup: reusing retained prefix caches` on every reload in the log). The
/// only post-idle difference is the ~1.8 s intercept, which is the weight
/// reload the utterance waits out inside its own deadline (`cleanup: loaded …
/// in 1.3–2.2s`). That is what `reloadCreditCapS` gives back.
///
/// Those fits predict the budget is exhausted at ~1316 chars warm / ~1134
/// post-idle, and that is exactly where the observed failures sit: the longest
/// SUCCESSFUL cleanup was 1050 chars (9.7 s), while the recorded timeouts were
/// 1189, 1512, 1548, 1783 and 2053 chars. Two of them followed gaps under
/// 300 s, so eviction was never the discriminator — length was.
///
/// A deadline is a CEILING, not a sleep: a generous one costs nothing when
/// generation finishes early, and only binds on a genuinely slow or runaway
/// pass. So the policy errs generous and bounds the worst case with
/// `ceilingS` instead of squeezing the common case.
