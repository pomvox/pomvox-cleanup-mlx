/// Greedy generation with optional prompt-lookup speculative decoding, written
/// against the model's plain forward pass so it works on a HYBRID model.
///
/// Why not `MLXLMCommon.SpeculativeTokenIterator`: it throws unless every
/// cache is trimmable, and Qwen3.5's linear-attention layers keep a running
/// recurrence (`MambaCache`, never trimmable). Rejected draft tokens have
/// already been blended into that state, so there is nothing to drop off the
/// end. This loop sidesteps trimming entirely with SNAPSHOT + REPLAY:
///
///   1. copy every cache (a few short K/V tensors and 18 small recurrent
///      states — cheap),
///   2. run `[last] + draft` through the model in ONE pass and argmax every
///      position,
///   3. keep the longest prefix the model agrees with; if it agreed with all
///      of them the caches are already correct, otherwise restore the copies
///      and carry the accepted tokens into the NEXT pass, which reads them
///      again ahead of the next draft — so both cache kinds land on exactly
///      the state a token-at-a-time decode would have had.
///
/// Architecture-agnostic — it never asks a cache what kind it is. A miss costs
/// a slightly longer next pass, never an extra one.
///
/// Greedy only: the accepted tokens are exactly what argmax would have
/// produced one at a time, so the text is byte-identical to the non-speculative
/// loop. `CleanupSpeculativeDifferentialTests` pins that against the real
/// model; if it ever fails, `CleanupPromptProfile.usesSpeculativeDecoding` goes
/// back to `false`.
