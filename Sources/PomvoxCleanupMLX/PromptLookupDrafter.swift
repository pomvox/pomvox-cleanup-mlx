/// Cleanup is a rewrite: most output tokens are copies of input tokens, in
/// order. So instead of a second network guessing what comes next, look up the
/// last few generated tokens in the input (plus everything generated so far)
/// and propose the tokens that followed them there. The model then verifies
/// the whole proposal in ONE forward pass — a k-token read costs about the
/// same as a one-token write on a bandwidth-bound M1 — and keeps the longest
/// prefix it agrees with. Greedy verification makes the output byte-identical
/// to plain greedy decoding; a bad guess costs one wasted pass, never a wrong
/// token.

/// Pure logic, no MLX: `draft` is a table lookup over `[Int]`, unit-tested on
